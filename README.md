# Micronx

A demo application for conventional micro frontend architecture, based on the [Thoughtworks article](https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html). This project uses [Nx](https://nx.dev) as a means of better managing micro frontends within a monorepo.

## Running the micro frontend example

Run the entire application:

```
yarn start
```

Run a micro frontend on its own:

```
nx run dashboard:serve # or settings:serve
```

# Nx generated docs

## Generate an application

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@micronx/mylib`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
